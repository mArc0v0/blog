I'm interested in what happens when you take sociological concepts seriously enough to quantify them — particularly in the direction of asset pricing.

**Curiosity** (好奇心) is the recurring theme. It's what I mean when I talk about life force, about what makes things worth pursuing.

I write in Chinese and English, sometimes in the same sentence. Not to be cute — because some ideas are sharper in one language than the other.

This blog has two sections:
- **Essays** — longer, more structured pieces
- **Fragments** — raw thoughts, one-liners, things I haven't figured out yet

Background: economics/finance training + philosophy/sociology obsession. Bourdieu, Foucault, Merleau-Ponty, Han Byung-Chul, Arendt. I think the most interesting work happens at the intersection of empiricism and non-empiricism.

Lifetime goal: **Decision Theory**.
