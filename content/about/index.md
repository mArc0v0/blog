## Why *Esquisse of Erzählen*?

**Esquisse** comes from Bourdieu's *Esquisse d'une théorie de la pratique* — sketch, draft, outline. Not a finished system, but a working attempt. The word carries a productive humility: these are thoughts still taking shape.

**Erzählen** is Han Byung-Chul's concept of narration — as opposed to information. Information is consumed and discarded; narration lingers, transforms the listener. In a world drowning in information, choosing to *narrate* is already a stance.

The combination: **sketches of narration**. Thinking that doesn't pretend to be finished. Writing that tries to be more than information.

**Essays** — longer pieces. **Fragments** — raw thoughts, things I haven't figured out yet.

Written in Chinese and English — because some ideas are sharper in one language than the other.
